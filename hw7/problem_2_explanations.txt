As we can observe in the graph (see picture "problem_2_time_complexities.png"), the best case running time 
for this particular method of partitioning is when the list is randomly generated. The worst cases are 
when the list is either sorted from before, either sorted descending, since the pivots will always be placed
at the end of beginning of the list, causing the partition to not be efficient.
